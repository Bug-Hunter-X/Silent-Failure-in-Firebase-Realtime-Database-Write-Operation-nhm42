In a Firebase project, I encountered an issue where data wasn't being written to the Realtime Database even though my code appeared correct. The `set()` method didn't throw any errors, and the data was properly structured. After hours of debugging, I found the cause to be a missing security rule. Specifically, the database rule for writing was too restrictive, preventing my client application from making any changes.  The rule was unintentionally set to only allow reads.
